- **COMMENTS DETECTED** (Comments indicate code that is not self-documenting.)
- **HIGH COMPLEXITY** (Complex functions are harder to understand, test, and maintain.)
- **CRITICAL: OVERSIZED FUNCTIONS** (Functions over 10 lines violate single responsibility principle.)
- **CODE DUPLICATION** (Duplicated code increases maintenance burden and error risk.)
